The last thing that I have been stuck on is trying to learn JAVA. Tried learning it way too late in the cycle. We should have picked a language
that everone on the team knows well ( such as c++ or python) but this is all in hindsight. We have got everything done on the IndoorAtlas side 
and was just trying to merge it all together with the code that we had originally created. This wasnt goign so well, so with about 2 weeks left 
we decided to try and make a new app altogether. Wit the holidays and that sort of thing it was really hard to get soemthing pushed out while trying 
to learn a completely new programming language.
